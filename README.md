Ryan Hub's pong game

This pong game includes the main file, the header file, and the implementation file. To create the movement of the ball
that would be used for the game pong. The implementation file includes the functions used to create the ball, move the
ball, and detect if the ball hits the any side of the window. The header file defines any of the constants used and defines
the function prototypes. The main file initializes the starting variables and calls upon the different functions in the
implementation file to create ball and have the ball move around the window.
